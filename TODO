- Dump old Postgres from Heroku /
- Import to supabase /
- Set up row level security on supabase /
- Convert to using supabase rest https://github.com/marmelab/ra-supabase (might need v4) /
- Check whether I need to upgrade to React Admin v4: https://marmelab.com/react-admin/doc/4.0/Upgrade.html /

- ra-supabase does not work with react v4 /

- signup /login does not work, it consumes invation but no password is set? Maybe it's set up to password less? /

- maybe signup should be on in supabase? /

Signup/invite user is completely broken with ra-supabase
So I bypassed it by enabling sign ups, then calling sign up with curl using the service role key and disabled it again. /

- Change RLS to only allow CUD from my account /
- Create a new anon user (which would have read only)
- Add the credentials on the login screen so others can do read only
